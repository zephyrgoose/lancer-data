      "description": "<p>A sidegraded cousin of IPS-N&rsquo;s Lancaster support frame, the Kidd was produced under a joint development contract by IPS-N&rsquo;s Titan&ndash;Enceladus Field Project and Northstar Branch Robotics. The original pattern for the frame was bought off a mining commune that had rigged their support drones in a slapdash but ingenious neural mesh that both hardened them against tech intrusion and increased their operational efficiency many times over. Urban legend was that the original builder of the rig had used his drone team to bury caches of black-market Volador tech in several wandering asteroids, and out of extreme paranoia made his systems almost impossible to crack. To this day Northstar Branch Robotics tries valiantly to squash down persistent rumors that clues to the location of the caches are hidden in the Kidd&rsquo;s code base.</p> <p>Designed to provide an aggressive, all-theater support solution to rugged field teams in hostile environments, the Kidd mounts a trio of powerful systems to ensure a broad operational envelope. The Jolly Roger semiautonomous personal orbital platform, bundled with every genuine-license Kidd platform establishes theater control in any open or near-surface environment. A squadron of bundled subalterns (along with an onboard maintenance suite) guarantees friendly support in any environment and provides a broad suite of tactical possibility. Finally, Titan&ndash;Enceladus&rsquo;s SMOKESTACK heat sink pylon represents the cutting edge of IPS-N&rsquo;s thermodynamic axiomatics, allowing users to offset surplus heat via the creation of a pinhole-window into an omega state of absolute zero.</p> <p>The Kidd is a popular chassis in Evergreen where it is employed as a subaltern command platform for civilian and engineering purposes. Its familiar bulk can also regularly be seen accompanying traders on their way to do business with the Gray Towns.</p>",

Deployed in limited numbers against the remaining Egregorian hives in the brutal last stages of the war, the Enkidu&rsquo;s neurological interfacing was dangerous: raw and unshielded. The power and aggression flowing through the subroutines that govern the mech bled into its pilot&rsquo;s subjectivity, making them lose themselves in a storm of violence, constantly pushing themselves to greater and greater acts of destruction. This effect was incredibly hard for pilots to handle &ndash; the fallout rate from the program was extremely high, and the survivors required extensive conditioning, implants, and a cocktail of neurological suppressants to continue.</p> <p>The true aim of the Enkidu program was not to fight Egregorians, which were in the final stages of practical extinction, but to use the battlefield as a testing ground for the eventual deployment of the chassis against ThirdComm revolutionaries and dissidents. Though the codebase for the Enkidu was eventually discontinued and molded into what is now the Tokugawa, the difficulties with the initial project prevented it from getting off the ground before the revolution took hold.

This substance, commonly called locus, induces feelings of opennness, euphoria, enhanced empathy, and altered sensory perceptions including mild hallucinations and synaesthesia.

      "description": "Popular among colonial militias, the plasma maul is a heavy but simple device. High-density magnetic plasma capacitors have a wide range of applications, from power storage through to construction and defense. In the case of the plasma maul, they are mounted in rows along a reinforced haft and set to discharge on contact, making this a devastating closequarters weapon limited only by its need to recharge between strikes. Early models featured ejectable capacitor banks, but contemporary versions are designed to draw power directly from a chassis’ reactor.",

      "description": "An obsolete chassis-grade anti-materiel/ anti-armor rifle dating back to the Hercynian Crisis, this particular design has not been in distribution for hundreds of years but finds continued use among contemporary Hercynian forces. Bulkier and more cumbersome than the current GMS T-3 anti-materiel rifle, this particular model lacks many of the refinements incorporated into later models and is meant to be employed with a dedicated spotter to provide targeting data. All the same, its heavy, highvelocity rounds remain extremely effective at defeating both armor and static defenses at extreme range.",

      "description": "The “steelpunch”, as it’s affectionately known, is a twin-beam directed-energy weapon developed by HUC engineers for use against the heavily reinforced hulls of remnant chassis and other hardened targets. The earliest models were derived from Second Committee–era mineral surveying lasers. An initial beam flash-vaporizes the target’s outer layer and the plasma bloom is instantly analyzed for material density and structural composition, following which the needlebeam fires a focused, highintensity pulsed beam tuned to defeat heavy armor. Performance against softer targets is significantly reduced, however, as excessive material ablation disrupts the secondary beam before an optimal effect can be achieved.",
