      "description": "Following the commercial failure of the Raleigh, several third parties found themselves with the opportunity of buying out development rights for the license as IPS-N sought to recoup initial costs. One of the companies that found itself in this position, Anton Industries, had fallen on hard times after its CEO vanished in mysterious circumstances, leading to plummeting stocks. <br>Chasing a lucky break and seizing the opportunity, Anton Industries began work on what would ultimately be the last frame ever to be developed under its name. Basing the modifications to the Raleigh on one of its own mechs – the Hades Mk3 – Anton Industries quickly developed the frame into a capable combined-arms platform emphasizing speed and rapid deployment. Instead of the Raleigh’s integrated Mjolnir, a weapon far too heavy for the new doctrinal approach, the modified chassis sports an internal reservoir of TRUESILVER nanites, a proprietary whitewash product capable of enhancing a weapon’s destructive power on a strike-to-strike basis. <br>The resulting mech was named “Störtebeker” after an old Cradle legend in a fit of gallows humor regarding the company’s less than ideal position. The frame, just like its namesake, ultimately spelled doom for the company, despite its relative success. <br>Quickly gaining popularity among mercenaries, black-ops units, and bounty hunters alike, the Störtebeker became the frame of choice for those requiring speed and maneuverability out of an IPS-N base but who preferred a solid ranged component over the Nelson’s dedicated close-combat focus. <br>IPS-N itself, interested in the Störtebeker, eventually decided to buy out the smaller company and, indifferent to Anton Industries’ other projects and subsidiaries, cannibalized the company in its entirety. Thus, the Störtebeker, now licensed fully as a Raleigh variant-frame under the IPS-N label, stands as a testament to a company’s destruction and how sometimes, one can do well and fail because of it.",

Originally developed under the moniker “MicroMonarch”, the scaled-down frame is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and sports the high-quality engineering expected from all SSC mechs. Where the Monarch focuses on devastating long-range firepower, the Viceroy is more akin to a close-range brawler, using its sophisticated near-threat targeting arrays to wield the launchers of its sibling with deadly precision. <br>Equipped with a scaled-down version of the Monarch’s own SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System, the Viceroy is more than capable of saturating an area around itself with relatively small but high-yield warheads, aimed with pinpoint accuracy. <br>This, coupled with an integrated, one-use burst jump pack, turns the Viceroy into a potent shock trooper with devastating first-strike capabilities. This role is supported by its ability to shrug off any potential self-inflicted harm from any “shock and awe” maneuvers thanks to its advanced blast-resistant armor plating. <br>Since its recent official release, the Viceroy has become – by SSC standards – an affordable frame that is now being widely rolled out to various SSC associates and subsidiaries. Slated to be approved for mass production, it is anticipated the Viceroy will become a frontline “soldier” mech to ultimately rival the likes of Harrison Armory’s Sherman.",

      "description": "The Madrigal line of personal protection hardsuits, manufactured by Cyprian Industries, represents some of the best void-capable combat suits available. Designed for carrying out and defending against boarding actions, the Madrigal system is modular and can be adjusted to tackle varied tactical situations. While inferior to heavier, dedicated boarding hardsuits and mechs such as the IPS-N Caliban and the Harrison Armory Kutuzov, the Madrigal yet boasts an impressive degree of personal protection without sacrificing mobility or agility. Compact enough to be worn in a mech’s cockpit, the Madrigal is slowly but steadily encroaching on the pilot hardsuits market. Its superior protection, armaments, and auxiliary systems make it an attractive choice for lancers everywhere.",
