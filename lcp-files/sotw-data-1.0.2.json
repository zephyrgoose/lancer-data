The Blue Blood of Pangloss is impossible to reproduce without access to specific Begi flora and the secret distillation techniques of the Xenoglossary. Unless a PC has both of these, it can only ever be acquired as a limited-use reserve (at extraordinary cost). Those who steal or abuse the Blue Blood often find themselves the targets of the Stygos Grammaton.",
