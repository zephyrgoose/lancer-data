    "description": "A strong base-layer suit that recycles water, generates nutrients, and adapts very rapidly to hostile environs, maintaining a stable condition and extending survivability. Flexsuit wearers can go for roughly a week without eating or drink thanks to the ambrosia paste generated by their suit before its systems are depleted; however, they don’t prevent feelings of hunger. Removing the suit for a day or two is enough to replenish its reserves. Flexsuits also maintain a steady temperature within acceptable parameters.",

Users of these suites blend the organic with the synthetic, gaining the ability to extrude implanted universal-plug cables from within their body to make hardline connections with terminals. When plugged in, users can access a comprehensive, fully interactive alternate-reality interface with direct omninet access, making navigating – or hacking – local and networked systems as easy as wishing it so (of course, you must be careful: by opening up your mind to the digital, you may face dangers other, less enhanced people are ignorant of).",

The sylph bonds to its wearer, forming a symbiotic relationship: the sylph is sustained by the host’s waste products, in return protecting the host from a range of hostile environmental factors.<br>These semi-biological, skin-tight undersuits can be worn for extended periods. They are translucent, semi-liquid, and able to be stored when not in use, conforming to whatever container they are placed in. They clean the host’s body, aid natural healing processes, and eliminate waste. As desired, segments can become opaque, change color, or take on a new texture. Sylph undersuits can cover the host’s head, sealing against vacuum, providing protection against radiation, and filtering air or liquids, even providing the ability to breathe water for a limited time.",
