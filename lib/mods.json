On penetration, the pike’s head is severed from the shaft – moments later, the embedded pike head detonates in a conical explosion from the point forward. Spare thermal charges are stable, and transported in external tube magazines.<br>IPS-N also makes thermal charges compatible with GMS’s range of blades, hammers, and picks.",

To put it simply, phase-ready rounds, when fired, exist in two places at once: exiting the barrel of the weapon they were fired from, and directly in front of the target, prior to impact. The prime round may never hit its target, but given it already exists at the moment of impact, the doppelgänger round will reliably reach its mark.",
