GMS quick developed the Krakatoa – a thermobaric flamethrower – and disseminated it to affiliates. The Krakatoa was quickly adopted by Union’s Marine Expeditionary Forces, seeing heavy use in the depths of the Hercynian continental jungles thanks to its stability, reliability, and stopping power.<br>Later reworked and adopted by the Armory following the resolution of the Hercynian Crisis, the Krakatoa has become a popular tool for the creation of area-of-denial firebreaks.",

In terms of appearance, the Displacer could be mistaken for a conventional energy rifle, but it requires a massive secondary, dorsal-mounted reactor: when fired, the Displacer identifies a bubble of local space (size and location determined on an ad hoc basis by the user) and snaps it into blinkspace. The destination of the bubble is unknown, but the effect is dramatic: anything inside simply ceases to exist in this dimension, transported somewhere in the void of blinkspace. The Displacer makes no sound when fired, but the sudden and necessary venting of its power supply is tremendous; similarly, the heatwave of its backblast vent is deadly to any unshielded personnel exposed to it.",

Tachyon lances project tachyon particles – essentially subatomic localized objects – faster than light toward their targets. These particles are impossible to perceive optically, and because they travel faster than light, can’t be seen or evaded. Although the particles are tiny, they travel with colossal speed and energy.
